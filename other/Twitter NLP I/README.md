1.	We will study the text in tweets over the next two classes. Our ultimate goal will be to build a model that can predict how much a tweet will be retweeted. To do this, our first task (the task for the first class) will be to process natural language into features that a machine learning algorithm can use. 
2.	To learn the basic terminology and steps involved in natural language processing (NLP), read https://www.dataquest.io/blog/natural-language-processing-with-python/ and http://desilinguist.org/pdf/crossroads.pdf.
3.	After reading about NLP, run through the starter code and see what it does. The code processes tweets on the key word “star wars”. The code also builds a simple model to predict retweets from a few basic features. Imagine you work at Disney. How might a model of this type inform your strategy for upcoming releases? What other features would you like to include in the model?
4.	Choose your own key word and rerun the code. Please choose a business-relevant key word – a key word on a subject that some company would care about. Add to the model any additional features you see fit. What explains why a tweet with your key word gets retweeted? Why would a company care to know what gets a tweet retweeted?
