Class 26: 	Yelp II

Module:     Machine Learning

Topic: 		NLP with Neural Networks

Case: 		Predicting Useful Yelp Reviews (QA-0829)

Data: 		yelp_training_set_review.csv

Code: 		YelpStarterWordEmbedding

Assignment:

Our goal with this class is to expose you to some cutting-edge techniques for doing syntactic/semantic analysis. Consequently, your preparation for this class will involve running the starter code and getting some sense for what is going on at a high-level. Some tools/techniques/concepts in the starter code are quite advanced, and we do not expect you to fully understand in this course how these things all work.

1.	Run the starter code. 
2.	As you run through the code, answer the following questions. You may want to do some Google searches to answer these questions. Some of these questions will be for review of previous classes.
    a.	What is tokenization? 
    b.	What is text normalization? What is lemmatization?
    c.	What is sentence segmentation?
    d.	What is phrase modeling? How is identifying two-word phrases based on a phrase model distinct from identifying all bigrams in a corpus? What is syntactic analysis?
    e.	What is word2vec? What are the tuning parameters of this model? How does this model help up do semantic analysis? 
    f.	How is the data structured before it is inputted into the keras neural network? What is sequence padding?
    g.	What is the difference between the network’s embedding layer, a dropout layer, a convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer, a bidirectional LSTM layer, and a dense layer?
    h.	How is the starter code’s naïve forecast generated?
    i.	How does the neural network’s performance compare to the naïve forecast? Why do you think it outperforms? What other features could improve its performance even more? 
3.	In this final class before the presentations, we will recap the course. Please come to class with your two top takeaways from the course.
