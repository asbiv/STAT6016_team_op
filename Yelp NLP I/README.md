Topic:         Semantic Analysis
Case:          Predicting Useful Yelp Reviews (QA-0829)
Data:          yelp_training_set_review.csv
Code:          YelpStarterSemanticAnalysis.ipynb                   

Assignment:    
1.	Read the case. Before working with the Yelp data, Yelp requires each student to agree to its terms of use. Please read Exhibit 2 of the case, and let us know by email before class that you agree to Yelp's terms of use.
2.	Read about topic modeling and the algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf and https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/.
3.	Run through the starter code. It implements LDA on the Yelp reviews in the training set. Use the visualization produced by the code to help you create names for the 10 topics. You will want to use the slider bar for lambda in order to get different top words for each topic. This task is the main task for the class. We are not asking you to build a predictive model and to compete on Kaggle for this class. Nonetheless, think about how controlling for topic would help predict useful votes.
4.	Which topics get the most useful votes? Which topics get the most stars?
